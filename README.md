# TDOA- and RSSI-based sound source localization

This project implements 3D sound source localization, based on Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) and Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI, power ratios) measurements. The main file, `provide_article_results.m`, outputs all the quantitative and qualitative results presented in my master's thesis and the article "Real-Time Identification and Localization of Transient Acoustic Events Using Low-Cost Hardware and Embedded Deep Learning."

The directory contains all necessary experiment data and helper functions. To display all results, simply run `provide_article_results.m` in your Matlab installation.
